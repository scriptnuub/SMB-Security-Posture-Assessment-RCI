Order (Priority),Solution,Problem,Prevented Problems,Relevance
1,Enforce Foundational Controls (MFA & Encryption). Mandate Multi-Factor Authentication for remote access and AES-256 encryption for data at rest.,Deficient Foundational Security Controls. Lack of basic hygiene allowed attackers easy entry and readable data access.,Prevented the initial credential theft and made the exfiltrated patient data unreadable/useless to attackers.,Critical Compliance: Directly addresses HIPAA requirements for protecting patient data (PH) and prevents massive regulatory fines.
2,Deploy Immutable Backup Strategy. Implement the 3-2-1 rule with offline/immutable storage that cannot be altered or deleted.,"Insufficient Backup & Recovery. Backups were accessible and deletable by the attackers, forcing a ransom payment",Would have allowed RCI to restore operations immediately without paying the ransom or losing data.,Business Continuity: Ensures the hospital can continue saving lives during a cyberattack without financial extortion.
3,Formalize IT Governance & Risk Register. Create a risk register requiring executive sign-off and updated Incident Response Plans (IRP).,"Ineffective Governance. Leadership hid the breach and lacked a plan, increasing legal liability.","Prevented the chaotic, illegal response and the ""cover-up"" attempt by the CFO.",Legal Liability: Protects the brand reputation and executives from negligence lawsuits or jail time.
4,Deploy Centralized Monitoring (SIEM/NIDS). Implement a system to aggregate logs and detect network intrusions in real-time.,"Lack of Monitoring. RCI was ""blind"" to the attackers moving through the network for days.","Would have alerted IT to the initial intrusion attempts, allowing containment before encryption occurred.","Operational Insight: Reduces ""dwell time"" (time hackers are inside), minimizing damage and investigation costs."
5,Implement Automated Asset Discovery. Deploy tools to continuously map all hardware and software on the network.,"Lack of Asset Inventory. ""Shadow IT"" and unmanaged devices created open doors for attackers.","Would have identified the vulnerable, unpatched server used as the entry point.",Cost Control: Eliminates waste on unused software and ensures 100% of assets are secured.
6,Establish Vulnerability Management Program. Schedule weekly automated scans and annual third-party penetration tests.,Absence of Audit Schedule. Vulnerabilities piled up because nobody was checking for them.,Would have flagged the specific software flaw the attackers exploited to gain entry.,"Proactive Defense: Finds and fixes holes before criminals can exploit them, maintaining system integrity."
