" Deficient Foundational Security Controls (Access Control, Encryption, and Awareness Training).","2:6, 2:7, 2:9, 4:14, 4:16, C:1","Enforce ""Zero Trust"" Basics (PR.AC / PR.DS / PR.AT): 1. Mandate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all remote access. 2. Enable AES-256 encryption for data at rest. 3. Conduct mandatory, role-based security awareness training for all staff."
"Insufficient Backup & Recovery strategy (Lack of immutability, offline storage, and regular integrity testing).","4:17, 5:18, 5:19","Deploy Immutable Backup Strategy (PR.IP-4): Adopt the ""3-2-1"" rule: 3 copies of data, 2 different media types, 1 stored offline/immutable. Test restoration quarterly to guarantee recovery from ransomware without paying ransoms."
" Ineffective IT Governance and Risk Management (Failure to update policies during M&A, align controls to business value, and prioritize compliance).","1:3, 1:4, 4:13, P-14","Formalize GRC & Incident Response (ID.GV / RS.RP): Update the Incident Response Plan (IRP) to include specific playbooks for ransomware. Establish a ""Risk Register"" that quantifies risk in dollars, requiring executive sign-off for any unmitigated risks."
 Lack of centralized Security Monitoring and Alerting infrastructure (SIEM/NIDS).,"3:10, 3:11",Deploy SIEM & NIDS (DE.AE): Implement a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system to aggregate logs. Deploy Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) at the network perimeter to alert on anomalous traffic immediately.
"Lack of a comprehensive, automated Asset Inventory and Management process.","1:2, 2:8","Implement Automated Asset Management (ID.AM): Deploy a continuous discovery tool (e.g., LanSweeper or Tenable) to map all hardware/software. Reconcile this inventory against the procurement list monthly to ensure no ""shadow IT"" exists."
 Absence of a recurring internal/external Audit and Vulnerability Assessment schedule.,"1:5, 3:12",Establish Vulnerability Management Program (ID.RA-1): Schedule automated vulnerability scans (weekly) and third-party penetration tests (annually). Link findings directly to a remediation ticket system with strict SLAs for patching.
